# In this code, identify the repeated pattern and replace it with
#  a function called month_days, that receives the name of the 
# month and the number of days in that month as parameters. 
# Adapt the rest of the code so that the result is the same. 
# Confirm your results by making a function call with the correct 
# parameters for both months listed.

# REPLACE THIS STARTER CODE WITH YOUR FUNCTION

# june_days = 30
# print("June has " + str(june_days) + " days.")
# july_days = 31
# print("July has " + str(july_days) + " days.")
